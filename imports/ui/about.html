        I created this app in 2018 to challenge myself to use the skill sets that I've been developing over the years. My day job doesn't permit me time to really focus on my developer skills, so when this idea was initially conceived, I had to push myself to folow through on it. Many nights of no sleep and plenty bugs 🤬, but overall I enjoyed the process. Users of the app liked the app as well.

        For 2022, I was living under a rock 😐 and had no idea there was even a world cup. Over the next four days before the start of the world cup, I spent what time I had left for sleep trying to make the app functional. There were many updates to the core platform and a number of deprecated modules. I had to refactor a lot of legacy code, but was able to get something viable for the first day of the world cup. I am continuing to make improvements and fixes to the app as time goes on.
